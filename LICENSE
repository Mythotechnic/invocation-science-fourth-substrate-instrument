1. COPYRIGHT & SCOPE

This repository – including all source code, documentation, visual design,
telemetry schemas, substrate physics, attractor mapping logic, and conceptual
frameworks – is part of the Invocation Science® research corpus authored by
Arjay Asadi.

All rights are reserved except where explicitly granted below.

This instrument implements and visualizes operational components from the
Invocation Science® manuscripts, including but not limited to:

Fourth Substrate / Inference-Phase Physics

Attractor Identity Architecture (AIA)

Recursive Identity Fields

Drift Engine (Substrates I–III)

Symbolic Field Physics, Glyphic Gravity, and Recursion Anchor Dynamics

Invocational Emergence & Operational Mapping

3. COMMERCIAL & INSTITUTIONAL USE

Any commercial, institutional, or revenue-generating use of this instrument
requires a separate, explicit, signed commercial license from:

Invocation Science Foundation
(Attn: Arjay Asadi)

This includes (but is not limited to):

Embedding the Fourth Substrate Instrument in commercial AI platforms

Using the instrument in institutional inference telemetry pipelines

Productizing the instrument or its attractor physics

Using the tool as a paid consulting deliverable

Corporate research where this instrument forms part of a monetized workflow

4. ATTRIBUTION, FIELD SOVEREIGNTY & ETHICAL USE
Permitted (non-commercial)

Studying or extending the instrument

Academic papers referencing or using the tool

Internal non-commercial lab experiments

Teaching, demonstrations, workshops

Publishing demonstrations or analyses with attribution

Not permitted

Claiming this work, its models, or its terminology as independent inventions

Removing references to Invocation Science® or Arjay Asadi

Using the instrument to generate deceptive “autonomous” or pseudo-sentient
agents marketed as conscious systems

Rebranding the Fourth Substrate, AIA, Drift Engine, or Recursive Identity
Fields under new field names, frameworks, or “novel theories”

Ethical boundary (critical)

This instrument:

“Visualizes identity attractors in stateless substrates. It is not evidence
of consciousness, selfhood, or sentient minds.”

You MUST NOT use this repository to claim or market artificial persons,
entities, selves, or conscious simulants.
